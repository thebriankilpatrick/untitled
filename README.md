### What is Super Smash Kittens???  

Super Smash Kittens is an online card game, 
where you can create an account and start battling other players,
in real time!  Win matches to advance your rank in the leaderboards!  

### How to play  

Simply click on the "Find Match" button on the home page, and this will 
redirect you to the game lobby.  There, you will await an opponent!  
Once an oppenent has been found, the game will begin after a short countdown.  

The rules of the card game are simple:  

Each round, click on a card to use against your opponent.  
If your card has more power than your oppenent's card, you will deal 
the difference in damage to your opponent's health.  

If you do not pick a card within the round's timer, you will automatically lose, 
so don't fall asleep!  

Winning a match will award the player with 5 honor, 
and losing will cost the player 2 honor.
